To be or not to be
All that glitters is not gold
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
I have a dream
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind
E=mc2
I think therefore I am
Knowledge is power
The unexamined life is not worth living
Give me liberty or give me death
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men are created equal
Ask not what your country can do for you
Veni vidi vici
Et tu Brute
Carpe diem
In vino veritas
Cogito ergo sum
Alea iacta est
Hello world
May the force be with you
Live long and prosper
To infinity and beyond
I'll be back
Here's looking at you kid
Frankly my dear I don't give a damn
You can't handle the truth
Life is like a box of chocolates
There's no place like home
Elementary my dear Watson
The truth is out there
Winter is coming
Valar morghulis
Not all those who wander are lost
One ring to rule them all
You shall not pass
With great power comes great responsibility
I am inevitable
I am Iron Man
Avengers assemble
Wakanda forever
Why so serious
I'm Batman
It's a bird It's a plane It's Superman
Thanos did nothing wrong
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
The answer to life the universe and everything is 42
Don't panic
So long and thanks for all the fish
Time is money
Actions speak louder than words
The pen is mightier than the sword
When in Rome do as the Romans do
All roads lead to Rome
Rome wasn't built in a day
Fortune favors the bold
Necessity is the mother of invention
A penny saved is a penny earned
Early to bed early to rise
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
Better late than never

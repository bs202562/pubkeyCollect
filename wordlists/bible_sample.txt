In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.
Let there be light
God is love
The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
He leadeth me beside the still waters
He restoreth my soul
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
For thou art with me
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
Thou anointest my head with oil
My cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever
For God so loved the world
That he gave his only begotten Son
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish
But have everlasting life
The truth shall set you free
Ask and it shall be given you
Seek and ye shall find
Knock and it shall be opened unto you
Love thy neighbor as thyself
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Blessed are the meek
For they shall inherit the earth
Blessed are the peacemakers
For they shall be called the children of God
The meek shall inherit the earth
Faith can move mountains
Eye for an eye
Turn the other cheek
Cast the first stone
The good shepherd
The prodigal son
Loaves and fishes
Water into wine
Render unto Caesar
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God
Man shall not live by bread alone
The love of money is the root of all evil
Genesis
Exodus
Revelation
Alpha and Omega
The beginning and the end
I am that I am
Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not steal
Honor thy father and thy mother
